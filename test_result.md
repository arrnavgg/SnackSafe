# Testing Protocol

This file contains the testing protocol for the potato chip defect detector application.

## Backend Testing

Backend testing will be performed using the deep_testing_backend_v2 agent.

## Frontend Testing

Frontend testing will be performed manually by the user unless requested otherwise.

## Test Results

backend:

    implemented: true
    working: true

    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Health check endpoint (/api/health) returns 200 OK with expected response structure."

  - task: "Image Prediction Endpoint"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Prediction endpoint (/api/predict) successfully processes image uploads and returns valid prediction results with all required fields."

  - task: "History Retrieval Endpoint"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0

      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "History endpoint (/api/history) returns a list of previous predictions with all required fields. Note: There is a discrepancy between IDs in predict and history endpoints - predict uses UUID while history uses MongoDB ObjectID."

  - agent: "testing"
    message: "All backend API endpoints are functioning correctly. The health check, prediction, and history endpoints all return the expected responses. There is a minor discrepancy in how IDs are handled between the predict and history endpoints - predict uses UUID while history uses MongoDB ObjectID. This doesn't affect functionality but could be improved for consistency."

    message: "Starting frontend testing for the potato chip defect detector. Will test the image upload component, results display component, and history display component."
