# Testing Protocol

This file contains the testing protocol for the potato chip defect detector application.

## Backend Testing

Backend testing will be performed using the deep_testing_backend_v2 agent.

## Frontend Testing

Frontend testing will be performed manually by the user unless requested otherwise.

## Test Results

backend:
  - task: "Health Check Endpoint"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Health check endpoint (/api/health) returns 200 OK with expected response structure."

  - task: "Image Prediction Endpoint"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Prediction endpoint (/api/predict) successfully processes image uploads and returns valid prediction results with all required fields."

  - task: "History Retrieval Endpoint"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/backend/server.py"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "History endpoint (/api/history) returns a list of previous predictions with all required fields. Note: There is a discrepancy between IDs in predict and history endpoints - predict uses UUID while history uses MongoDB ObjectID."

frontend:
  - task: "Image Upload Component"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/frontend/src/App.js"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: "NA"
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Need to test the image upload functionality."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Image upload component works correctly. File selection, preview display, and upload button functionality all work as expected. The component correctly handles image selection and displays a preview before analysis."

  - task: "Results Display Component"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/frontend/src/App.js"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: "NA"
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Need to test the results display functionality."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Results display component works correctly. After image analysis, it properly displays the detection result (defective/non-defective), confidence level, analysis timestamp, and the analyzed image. All elements render correctly."

  - task: "History Display Component"
    implemented: true
    working: true
    file: "/app/frontend/src/App.js"
    stuck_count: 0
    priority: "high"
    needs_retesting: false
    status_history:
      - working: "NA"
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "Need to test the history display functionality."
      - working: true
        agent: "testing"
        comment: "History display component works correctly. It successfully fetches and displays previous analysis results, showing the analyzed images, detection results, confidence levels, and timestamps. The refresh functionality also works as expected."

  - agent: "testing"
    message: "All backend API endpoints are functioning correctly. The health check, prediction, and history endpoints all return the expected responses. There is a minor discrepancy in how IDs are handled between the predict and history endpoints - predict uses UUID while history uses MongoDB ObjectID. This doesn't affect functionality but could be improved for consistency."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Starting frontend testing for the potato chip defect detector. Will test the image upload component, results display component, and history display component."
  - agent: "testing"
    message: "Completed frontend testing for the potato chip defect detector. All three components (Image Upload, Results Display, and History Display) are working correctly. The application successfully allows users to upload images, displays analysis results with all required information, and shows the history of previous analyses with refresh functionality. No major issues were found during testing."
